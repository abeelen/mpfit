This library contains a few useful routines converted from IDL. 

This package provides the python interface to the Levenberg-Marquardt MPFIT chi-square fitter (based on the IDL version of MPFIT by Craig Markwardt and first translation to python by Mark Rivers, ported to numpy by Sergey Koposov). It is based on numpy and implements important bugfixes from the IDL version of MPFIT.
